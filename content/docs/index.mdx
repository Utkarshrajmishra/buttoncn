description: High-quality button components you can copy and paste into your apps.

**Fluxera** is a curated collection of **beautiful, interactive buttons** that you can copy and paste directly into your web apps.

It focuses exclusively on **buttons** built for landing pages, call-to-actions, and user-facing interfaces where first impressions matter.

No bloated UI kits.  
No unnecessary abstractions.  
Just buttons — done right.

## Philosophy

I strongly believe that **good design adds real value to software**.

Design is one of the most important ways trust is established between you and an internet stranger. For internet businesses, that trust is often formed **before** a user reads your copy or understands your product.

Some questions visitors subconsciously ask themselves are:

- “Is this product legit?”
- “Does this feel professionally built?”
- “Can I trust this team?”

Buttons play a critical role in answering those questions.

### Why buttons matter

Buttons represent intent.

They are where users:
- sign up
- subscribe
- pay
- confirm actions
- move forward

A poorly designed button creates hesitation.  
A well-designed button creates confidence.

**Bad button design reflects poorly on the entire product.**  
It feels rushed, careless, and unstable — even if the underlying system is solid.

**Good button design signals discipline and attention to detail.**  
It makes users think:

> “If they care this much about small interactions, they probably care about everything else too.”

### Design builds trust

Great design doesn’t demand attention.  
It quietly reassures users that they’re in good hands.

You don’t even need to try the product — the design alone communicates quality, speed, and reliability.

## How Fluxera works

Fluxera follows the **shadcn registry philosophy**:

- Components are added via the [Shadcn](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components/tabs) CLI
- Files are copied directly into your project
- You fully own and control the code
